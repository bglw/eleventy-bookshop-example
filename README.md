# bookshop-example

This serves as an example of a fully-functioning implementation of [Bookshop 2.0](https://github.com/CloudCannon/bookshop) on a simple website.

To run locally:
```bash
npm install
npm install-jekyll
npm start
```

This will serve the website on localhost:6060, and components can be browsed in the bookshop renderer at /components. A hosted example of the website can be seen at [full-fall.cloudvent.net](https://full-fall.cloudvent.net/), with components browsable at [full-fall.cloudvent.net/components](https://full-fall.cloudvent.net/components#all_bookshop:jekyll).

Forking this repository and connecting it to CloudCannon will provide you with a functioning example of array structures when editing `index.html`, where you should be able to add new components to the `content_blocks` array and see then preview live on the page.
