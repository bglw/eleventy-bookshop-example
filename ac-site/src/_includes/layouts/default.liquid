        A data-bookshop-live enables live editing previews in CloudCannon.
        To enable live previews of new components, we render all components
        via a page component that expects an array of content blocks.

        data-bookshop-props is used to control what front matter to bind to.
        Here we want to bind to all the front matter, so that page.content_blocks
        is accessible from the bookshop renderer.

        This element will get picked up by the bookshop dev renderer if present,
        on production this does nothing.

        <!-- 
            Bookshop components are accessed using the bookshop tag, 
            using the same syntax as the standard Jekyll include tag.
